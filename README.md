# CI-python
Neural Net and Genetic Algorithm autonomous car simulation as part of EE40098 at the University of Bath.

This example code demonstrates a python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Net (NN) 
working together to form an autonomous controller to guide a car around a track. The GA progressively optimises
the performance of the car.
